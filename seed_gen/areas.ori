-- This file defines all of the pickups, areas, and connections making up the
-- logical progression of Ori DE randomizer.
-- 
-- Pickup definitions should be straightforward and should never need to
-- change. If they do, the format is:
--	 loc: pickup X Y type difficulty zone
-- Each piece of data must be separated by one or more spaces from the others,
-- and must not contain spaces. DON'T CHANGE THESE IF YOU DON'T HAVE A GOOD
-- REASON!
--
-- Area definitions are flexible and substantially up to judgment. The intent
-- of an area is to surround one or more pickup locations and a single,
-- coherent section of the game world. In limited circumstances, it may be
-- valid to create an area with zero pickups, in order to represent a notable
-- gating point where Ori may need some specific set of skills to pass through.
--
-- Areas should be built around an "anchor point." An anchor point is a spot in
-- the game world which is considered to represent where Ori would be if the
-- player reached a given area. Choose an anchor point that best reflects where
-- a typical person would view Ori as "being" when in that area.
--
-- Areas should be formatted as such:
--	 home: AreaName
--		 -- anchor point: describe where the anchor point is
--		 pickup: PickupWithinThisArea1
--		 pickup: PickupWithinThisArea2
--			 casual-core RequiredSkill RequiredEvent
--		 conn: DifferentAreaName
--			 standard-lure RequiredSkill
--			 expert-dboost Health=5
--			 master-core Free
--
-- Pickups should be referenced with "pickup:" and the name given must be of a
-- pickup specified earlier in the file. If the pickup is freely accessible
-- from the anchor point, then you don't need to specify any paths. Otherwise,
-- specify each path as the path set to which it belongs, followed by the set
-- of required skills or events, each separated by one or more spaces.
--
-- Connections should be referenced with "conn:" and the name given must be of
-- an area defined elsewhere in the file with "home:". If the connection is
-- freely available, then you don't need to specify any paths. Otherwise, paths
-- can be specified just as with pickups.
--
-- When specifying paths, do not assume anything about what skills Ori has,
-- regardless of what might have been needed to reach your area. Be explicit
-- for every pickup and connection about the full set of skills Ori will need
-- to reach it.
--
-- If a path requires damage boosting, you may specify it as Health=#, where #
-- is the total amount of health Ori needs to survive.
--
-- If a path requires energy, you may specify it as Energy=#, where # is the
-- total amount of energy Ori needs to pass through.
--
-- If a path requires keystones, you may specify it as Keystone=#, where # is
-- the number of keystones needed in Ori's inventory to open this connection.
--
-- Please make sure to provide a path describing the anchor point of your area.
-- This will make it much easier for others to collaborate on this logic.
